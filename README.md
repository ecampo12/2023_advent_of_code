# My solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles

Just my attempts at solving the puzzles, not necessarily the best solutions.

check out the puzzles at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

I will mainly be using python, but I might try some other languages as well.

## **Note**

- I will try to not post my puzzle input, so you will have to get your own.
- Python solutions were written in python 3.10.12 and may not work in older versions.
- Swift solutions were written in VSCode on Ubuntu 22.04 and may not work on other systems.
